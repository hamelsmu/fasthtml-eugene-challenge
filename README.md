The app will enable users to:
* upload a csv file to initialize a sqlite table
* update a row of the sqlite database
* delete a row of the sqlite database
* download the table of the sqlite table
To keep things simple for this comparison, we'll:
* Have a single table for the data
* Not have features for table deletes or overwrites once the single table has been initialized
